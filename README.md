```
Give me love and I'ma give it right back
Who knew cupid he could shoot me like that
Going stupid cause I want it so bad
(So bad)
Mona Lisa way I'm looking like art
Just one touch and now I'm livin' on Mars
Got me dizzy when I fall in your arms
(Your arms)
Oh the way you see right through me
(Got me thinking)
Oh you got me falling so hard
매일매일 Seeing these stars
Love with you is like the movies
(Am I dreaming?)
Drumming to the beat of my heart
Baby can we skip to that part
Put your body on my body
Won't you come and make your move
Ain't nobody, yeah 너만이
that can do it like you
Put your body on my body
Need that midnight rendezvous
Ain't nobody, yeah 너만이
Ain't nobody that can do it like you
Silhouette incredible
So high on the pedestal
Face on 10,sets me off
You can talk the talk
Can you walk the walk?
Take a picture baby click it click it make it
digital
Step out lookin' pretty fitted fitted never
typical
Oh the way you see right through me
(Got me thinking)
Oh you got me falling so hard
매일매일 Seeing these stars
Love with you is like the movies
(Am I dreaming?)
Drumming to the beat of my heart
Baby can we skip to that part
Put your body on my body
Won't you come and make your move
Ain't nobody, yeah 너만이
that can do it like you
Put your body on my body
Need that midnight rendezvous
Ain't nobody, yeah 너만이
Ain't nobody that can do it like you
No no body
No no, nobody
No no body
Ain't nobody that can do it like you
No no body
No no, nobody
No no body
Ain't nobody that can do it like you
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Nobody else makes me feel like you do
Don't say that it's
Too good to be true
Baby you already knew
Put your body on my body
Won't you come and make your move
Ain't nobody, yeah 너만이
that can do it like you
Put your body on my body
Need that midnight rendezvous
Ain't nobody, yeah 너만이
Ain't nobody that can do it like you
No no body
No no, nobody
No no body
Ain't nobody that can do it like you
No no body
No no, nobody
No no body
Ain't nobody that can do it like you
